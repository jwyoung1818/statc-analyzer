Less patently, the novel has echoes of The Consequences of Love (04), his curiously revisionist take on the male-friendship-exalting French-style noir or polar, and a morbid fascination with the type of dreary provincial “non-places” featured in The Family Friend (06) and This Must Be the Place (11).\r\n\r\nLittle wonder then, that part of the book is also set amidst the terrazze romane (upper-class rooftop parties) regularly attended by The Great Beauty’s main character, Jep Gambardella.
